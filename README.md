Features

üì∏ Smart Photo Classifier (PyTorch ResNet-50)

Upload a single photo for classification into 1000 ImageNet categories.
Displays top-5 predictions with confidence scores.

üìÅ Batch Processing

Upload multiple images simultaneously for fast classification.
View aggregated results in a data table.

ü©∫ Specialized Analyzers (TensorFlow/Keras Placeholder)

Medical Image Analyzer (X-ray detection demo).
Plant Disease Detector (mock output with recommendations).
Note: These are placeholder outputs and can be extended with actual TensorFlow models.

üë§ Face Analysis

Upload a photo with faces to analyze age, emotion, and gender.
Currently simulated with placeholder TensorFlow outputs.

üé• Real-time Camera Processing

Live webcam classification using streamlit-webrtc + PyTorch + OpenCV.
Predicts the top object in each frame and overlays results on video.
